To test the runtime of my 2 programs I ran the parallel followed by the sequential
for numbers of threads from 1 to 30
I used 1000000 iterations as i felt this provided better results as each test took
several seconds and could provide a reliable average

I was working under mac OSX using the clock_get_realtime Mac created by Blair Murray
but changed when I found barriers could not be used under OSX

For the tests I used Ubuntu 64-bit with an Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 and 4Gb of RAM

The results are quite clearly faster with the parallel function
and with larger numbers of threads
however the difference seems to increase less towards the larger thread numbers
and even takes longer in the very last examples.
